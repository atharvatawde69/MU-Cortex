📌 OVERALL PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT (UP TO NOW)
🧱 PHASE 1 — CORE ACADEMIC FOUNDATION (COMPLETED)
🗄️ Database (Supabase)

Finalized schema for:

users (scheme-locked)

subjects (scheme + semester + branch scoped)

topics (module-level granularity)

video_resources (YouTube cache)

channel_whitelist

Scheme isolation enforced at DB + API level

UUID-based routing implemented

RLS policies added incrementally and verified

Production-ready views created where needed

🔧 Backend (FastAPI)

Stable APIs:

/health

/subjects

/topics

/videos

Robust input validation

Graceful handling of bad UUIDs

Clean, frontend-safe response contracts

Scout Agent logic frozen and verified

Caching verified (7-day cache)

🖥️ Frontend (Next.js App Router)

Scheme selector with lock & reset

Scheme persistence via localStorage

Clean routing:

Landing → Dashboard → Subjects → Topics → Videos

Module-wise topic grouping

Skeleton loaders, error states, empty states

Backend as single source of truth

Frontend is render-only (no ranking logic)

🤖 TELEGRAM BOT — COMMUNITY NOTES PIPELINE (MAJOR ADDITION)
✅ What the Telegram Bot Can Do (CURRENT STATE)
🧠 Bot Core

Aiogram 3 bot created and stabilized

/start and /help commands working

Runs locally via terminal (MVP mode)

📤 File Upload Handling

Detects PDF uploads in Telegram channel

Handles direct channel uploads (no caption beforehand)

Prevents silent misclassification

🔄 Two-Step Tagging Safety Flow (CRITICAL FEATURE)

Upload without tags → bot blocks processing

Bot asks user to reply with tags

User replies → bot validates and continues

Prevents wrong scheme / subject pollution

🏷️ Tag Processing & Validation

Extracts:

Subject tag

Scheme tag

Internally maps subject tags → subject codes

Subject lookup done via subject code (not name)

Eliminated PostgREST crashes and ambiguity

Wrong subject → bot rejects with error

🗄️ Supabase Integration

Metadata-only storage (Telegram is file host)

Inserts into community_resources table

Stored fields include:

subject_id

scheme_id

file metadata

telegram_file_id

telegram_message_link

tags

status (pending by default)

🔐 Security & Visibility

Row Level Security enabled and verified

Students can see only approved resources

Pending uploads are invisible to frontend users

Service role (bot) bypasses RLS safely

👁️ Frontend-Ready View

community_resources_with_subject view created

Includes:

subject_name

subject_code

Verified with real Telegram uploads

No joins required in frontend/API

✅ End-to-End Verified

Telegram → Bot → Supabase → View

Multiple real PDFs tested

Duplicate uploads blocked

Correct scheme & subject mapping confirmed
