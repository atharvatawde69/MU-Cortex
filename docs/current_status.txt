📘 MU-Cortex — Current Project Status
Final, Consolidated (Authoritative)

This document captures the complete end-to-end status of the MU-Cortex project, including architectural decisions, abandoned approaches, validated pipelines, completed AI layers, frontend integration work, and internal tooling added to close Phase 3 properly.

All information reflects the current live system state.

🧱 PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION (SCHEME BRAIN) ✅

Status: Stable & Frozen

🎯 Goal

Build a reliable academic backbone before introducing AI or prediction logic.

🗄️ Database (Supabase) — Stable

Finalized Schema (Live)

users — scheme-locked students

subjects — scoped by scheme + semester + branch

topics — module-level granularity only

video_resources — cached YouTube results

channel_whitelist — trusted channel bias list

Key Architectural Decisions

Scheme isolation enforced at database + API level

UUID-based routing everywhere

RLS policies added incrementally and tested

No cross-scheme data leakage possible

➡️ Database layer frozen after this phase.

🔧 Backend (FastAPI) — Stable

Completed APIs

Endpoint	Purpose	Status
/health	Server health check	✅
/subjects	Fetch subjects	✅
/topics	Fetch topics by subject	✅
/videos	Ranked YouTube videos	✅

Stability Guarantees

Input validation

Safe 404 handling

No crashes on bad UUIDs

Clean response contracts

➡️ Backend foundation intentionally frozen.

🖥️ Frontend (Next.js App Router) — Stable

Completed Core Flows

Scheme lock & reset

Scheme persistence

Dashboard routing

Clean logout

Stabilized Routes

/ → Landing

/dashboard → Subjects

/dashboard/subject/[id] → Subject view (Tabs)

/dashboard/subject/[id]/[topic] → Topic (Videos / Notes)

➡️ Frontend initially render-only at this phase.

🤖 PHASE 2 — AUTO-SCOUT (CORE VALUE) ✅

Status: Completed & Frozen

🔹 PERSON D — YouTube Foundation

YouTube API v3 enabled

Quota-aware usage

Stats endpoint integrated

Channel whitelist with soft bias

🔹 PERSON B — Scout Agent (Frozen by Design)

Capabilities

Topic-aware YouTube search

~20 candidates per query

Deduplication

Scoring (views, comments, relevance)

Soft whitelist bias

7-day caching

➡️ Logic intentionally locked to avoid instability.

🔹 PERSON A — Frontend UX (Phase 2)

Subjects dashboard

Topics grouped by module

Videos page with:

Auto search

Manual sub-topic search

Cache indicators

Skeleton loaders

Error states

🔄 END-TO-END FLOW — VERIFIED

Landing
→ Scheme Lock
→ Subjects
→ Topics (Modules)
→ Videos (Auto search)
→ Optional sub-topic prompt
→ Ranked + cached results

✔️ Fully tested locally.

🧠 PHASE 3 — PYQ INGESTION (MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT) ✅

Status: Core Completed & Verified

❌ INITIAL APPROACH (ABANDONED)

Attempted Pipeline

PDF → pdfplumber

OCR fallback via Tesseract

Raw text extraction

Regex + LLM parsing

Problems Encountered

Watermarks

Broken glyphs

Random character ordering

OCR destroyed semantic structure

⚠️ Root Cause: OCR ≠ semantic document understanding
➡️ Approach fully abandoned.

✅ FINAL SOLUTION — GEMINI VISION (ADOPTED & VERIFIED)

Strategy

PDF → Gemini 2.5 Flash Vision → Structured Questions

No OCR

No regex guessing

No corrupted text

Script Added

pyq_pipeline/parse_pyq_vision.py

Capabilities

Layout understanding

Question hierarchy

OR blocks

Marks extraction

✔️ Manual verification passed.

🗃️ DATA FLOW — COMPLETED

Step 1 — Vision Output
pyq_parsed/<paper>_vision.json

Step 2 — Supabase Ingestion
pyq_pipeline/ingest_questions.py

Canonical normalization

SHA-256 deduplication

Inserts:

questions

question_appearances

Fully idempotent

🗄️ FINAL PYQ DATABASE SCHEMA (LIVE)

questions (Canonical)
id, question_text, marks, topic_id, approved, normalized_hash, created_at

question_appearances (History)
question_id, appeared_in, year, subject_id, scheme_id, confidence, created_at

✔️ Enables frequency analytics & prediction

📊 INGESTION RESULTS (CURRENT)

Subjects: AI, CN

Canonical questions: 60+

Appearances: 60+

✔️ Reworded concepts stored separately
✔️ Semantic merging deferred

🧪 PHASE 3 — REVIEW & ANSWER ENGINE ✅
🔹 Review Tool (Streamlit)

Human approval gate

Batch approve

Session caching

Performance optimized

🔹 Answer Engine (FastAPI + Gemini)

MU-style formatting

5M / 10M aware

Diagram placeholders

Optional transcript grounding

Endpoint:
/answers/generate ✅

🖥️ PHASE 3 — FRONTEND INTEGRATION ✅

Community notes (Telegram-backed)

Subject-level questions (locked decision)

Filters, sorting, answer generation

MU-aligned rendering

🧠 PHASE 4 — ANALYTICS, PREDICTION & STUDY INTELLIGENCE ✅

Status: Completed

Phase 4 converts PYQ history into exam intelligence without modifying any frozen architecture.
