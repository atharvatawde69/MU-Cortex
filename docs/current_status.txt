🧱 PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION (SCHEME BRAIN)
🎯 Goal
Create a reliable academic backbone before adding AI.
🗄️ Database (Supabase)
Finalized schema (live):
* users — scheme-locked students
* subjects — scheme + semester + branch scoped
* topics — module-level topics (current granularity)
* video_resources — cached YouTube results
* channel_whitelist — trusted channel bias list
Key decisions:
* Scheme isolation enforced at DB + API level
* UUID-based routing to avoid collisions
* RLS policies added incrementally and tested
🔧 Backend (FastAPI)
Completed APIs:
EndpointPurposeStatus/healthServer check✅/subjectsFetch subjects by scheme/sem/branch✅/topicsFetch module-wise topics✅/videosFetch ranked YouTube videos✅
Stability work done:
* Input validation
* Safe 404 handling
* No hard crashes on bad UUIDs
* Clean response contracts for frontend
🖥️ Frontend (Next.js App Router)
Core flows completed:
* Scheme selector with lock + reset
* Scheme persistence via localStorage
* Redirect to dashboard after lock
* Logout clears scheme safely
Routing stabilized after refactors:
* / → Landing
* /dashboard → Subjects
* /dashboard/subject/[id] → Topics
* /dashboard/subject/[id]/[topic] → Videos
🤖 PHASE 2 — AUTO-SCOUT (CORE VALUE)
🎯 Goal
Replace manual YouTube searching with intelligent, syllabus-aware discovery.
🔹 PERSON D — YouTube Foundation (Completed)
YouTube API
* API v3 enabled & tested
* Quota-aware usage
* Statistics endpoint integrated
Channel Whitelist
* Priority-based (soft bias, not hard filter)
* Initial trusted creators added
* Ready for expansion (8–15 channels planned)
🔹 PERSON B — Scout Agent & Intelligence (Completed)
Scout Agent Logic (Frozen)
What it does:
* Searches YouTube using:
   * Topic name (auto)
   * Optional user-entered subtopic prompt
* Pulls ~20 candidate videos
* Deduplicates by video ID
* Scores videos using:
   * Views
   * Comments
   * Title relevance
   * Description relevance
* Applies soft whitelist bias
* Demotes irrelevant videos (even if whitelisted)
* Sorts server-side (frontend is render-only)
* Caches results for 7 days
⚠️ Scout logic is intentionally frozen to avoid instability.
/videos Endpoint (Stable)
* Supports:
   * Auto topic search
   * Manual free-text search within topic context
* Returns:
   * Ranked videos
   * Cached flag
   * Metadata for UI
* Cache hit verified via repeated calls
/topics Endpoint (New, Verified)
* Returns:
   * Subject name
   * Modules
   * Topics grouped by module number
* Designed explicitly for frontend rendering
🔹 PERSON A — Frontend UX (Completed)
Subjects Dashboard
* Fetches from backend
* Displays cards with topic counts
* Skeleton loaders
* Error & empty states
Topics Page
* Module-wise grouping
* Clean navigation
* Responsive layout
Videos Page
* Auto search on load
* Manual sub-topic search input
* Cached indicator
* Skeleton loaders
* Error handling
* Click → opens YouTube
Important UX decision:
* No ranking logic in frontend
* Backend = single source of truth
