📘 MU-Cortex — Phase 4 Report
Person C: Analytics & Prediction Engine

Phase: 4 (Days 7–10)
Owner: Person C
Status: ✅ Completed
Primary Goal: Convert historical PYQs into actionable exam intelligence (pass-focused + score-aware)

🎯 Phase 4 Objective (Person C)

Build a data-backed exam intelligence layer that:

Identifies high-frequency / repeat questions

Predicts high-probability exam questions

Powers Survival Mode and Full Prep Mode

Is fast, explainable, and safe (no ML black box)

✅ What Was Implemented
1️⃣ Frequency Analytics System (Supabase Views)

Created a full analytics layer using read-only SQL views (zero runtime cost):

Views implemented:

question_frequency
→ Base appearance counts, first/last year, exam history

high_frequency_questions
→ Filters questions with ≥2 appearances + recency-weighted score

subject_question_stats
→ Subject-level coverage & high-frequency percentage

marks_distribution
→ 2M / 5M / 10M distribution per subject

question_predictions
→ Final prediction score + study priority (must_study, should_study)

Key properties:

Scheme-aware (2019 / 2024 ready)

Approval-respecting (approved = true only)

Idempotent and safe to re-run

No schema changes

2️⃣ Prediction & Analytics API (/analytics)

Built a read-only analytics router for downstream usage.

Endpoints delivered:

GET /analytics/predictions/subject/{subject_id}
→ Ranked predictions (supports filtering)

GET /analytics/stats/subject/{subject_id}
→ Subject-level analytics summary

GET /analytics/study-plan/survival/{subject_id}
→ Time-aware survival study plan

Notable fixes:

Correct handling of numeric prediction_score (Supabase/PostgREST edge case)

Python-side filtering for safety and correctness

Outcome:

Person B fully unblocked for Study Modes

Frontend-ready, stable contract

3️⃣ Prediction Report Generator (Offline Tool)

Created an offline report generator for validation and distribution.

Script: pyq_pipeline/generate_reports.py

Outputs:

CSV study guide (structured, analyzable)

TXT summary (student-readable)

Report characteristics:

Includes only high-frequency questions (≥2 appearances)

Shows:

Total repeat-worthy questions

Priority breakdown

Top 15 questions by prediction score

Intentionally excludes one-time questions

Validated on:

Artificial Intelligence (CSC503)

Computer Networks (CSC501)

4️⃣ Analytics & Validation Dashboard (Streamlit)

Built an internal-only dashboard for prediction sanity checks.

Features:

Subject selector (scheme-aware)

Top metrics:

Total high-frequency questions

Coverage %

Avg prediction score

Tabs:

Frequency Analysis

Predictions

Marks Distribution

CSV export for predictions

Purpose:

Internal validation

Confidence building before student exposure

Ongoing tuning reference

📊 Key Outcomes & Insights

High-frequency questions form a small, high-ROI subset
(e.g., 18/79 for AI, 24/89 for CN)

Repeated questions dominate exam relevance

Survival Mode goal is achievable:

15–20 questions → ~60–70% exam coverage

System correctly favors passing under time pressure

No architectural debt introduced

✅ Phase 4 — Person C Checklist (Final)

 Analytics views created and verified in Supabase

 Prediction scoring logic implemented

 Study priority classification working

 Analytics API endpoints live and tested

 Survival Mode data contract ready

 Report generator producing CSV + TXT

 Dashboard visualizing frequency & predictions

 Edge cases validated (numeric filters, repeats)

 No schema / scout / prompt changes

Status: ✅ COMPLETE

🔮 Future Improvements (Post-Phase 4)

Explicitly deferred — not required for launch

1️⃣ Semantic Clustering (Phase 5)

Group near-duplicate questions with same intent

Preserve example diversity

Compute frequency at cluster level

2️⃣ Time-Aware Prediction Tuning

Dynamically adjust priorities based on:

Days left to exam

Marks distribution

Better Full Prep vs Survival differentiation

3️⃣ Reference Book Grounding

Link predictions to:

MU-recommended textbooks

Page/section references

4️⃣ Cross-Subject Pattern Mining

Identify examiner patterns across subjects

Detect “favorite question templates”

5️⃣ Student Outcome Feedback Loop

Track:

What students studied

What actually appeared

Improve prediction weights over time

🧾 Final Summary

Phase 4 successfully transforms MU-Cortex from a PYQ system into an exam intelligence engine.

Person C has:

Delivered reliable analytics

Enabled predictive study modes

Provided internal validation tools

Maintained architectural discipline

👉 Ready for launch-facing features (Person B / Person A).
