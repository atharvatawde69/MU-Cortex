📦 MU-Cortex Git & GitHub Workflow Guide

This document explains how the project was committed and pushed to GitHub, why a GitHub token was required, and how team members should use the repository safely and efficiently.

1️⃣ Repository Structure on GitHub

The GitHub repository now contains three clearly separated responsibilities:

MU-Cortex/
│
├── mu-cortex-frontend/     # Person A – Next.js frontend
│
├── mu-cortex-backend/      # Person B – FastAPI backend
│
├── schema.sql              # Person C – Database schema
├── syllabus_seed_data.csv  # Person C – Seed data
├── DATABASE_SETUP.md       # Person C – DB handoff documentation
│
├── docs/                   # Project checklists & planning
│
└── .gitignore              # Root ignore rules (env, venv, etc.)


This structure allows:

Independent frontend & backend work

Clear ownership per role

No mixing of secrets or environments

2️⃣ How Commits Were Organized (Best Practice)

We did NOT commit everything at once.
Commits were made role-wise, which makes history readable and safe.

✅ Commit Order
🔹 Commit 1 — Person C (Database)

schema.sql

syllabus_seed_data.csv

DATABASE_SETUP.md

Supabase-related documentation

📌 Purpose:

Establish database as the source of truth before app logic.

🔹 Commit 2 — Person A (Frontend)

mu-cortex-frontend/app/

components/, lib/

Supabase anon-key integration

SchemeSelector logic

UI structure

📌 Purpose:

Lock frontend skeleton and Supabase read/write path.

🔹 Commit 3 — Person B (Backend)

mu-cortex-backend/app/

FastAPI routers, models, cache

Supabase service-role integration

/health, /subjects, /videos endpoints

📌 Purpose:

Provide API layer between frontend and database.

🔹 Commit 4 — Docs & Hygiene

docs/

.gitignore updates

Ignoring venv/, .env, .env.local

📌 Purpose:

Prevent secrets, environments, and local files from leaking.

3️⃣ Why a GitHub Token Was Required
❌ Old way (no longer allowed)

GitHub does NOT allow password authentication for Git operations anymore.

✅ Correct modern way

GitHub requires a Personal Access Token (PAT).

What the token does

Acts like a temporary password

Allows Git to authenticate securely

Can be:

Scoped (only repo access)

Expired

Revoked anytime

Why this is safer

No real password exposure

Tokens can be rotated

Fine-grained access control

4️⃣ How the Push Was Done (Correct Flow)
1. Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/MU-Cortex.git

2. Push using token
git push -u origin main


When prompted:

Username → GitHub username

Password → paste the token (not GitHub password)

GitHub token- <REDACTED>
