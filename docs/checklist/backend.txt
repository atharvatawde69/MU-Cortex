✅ Backend Project Setup

FastAPI backend created: mu-cortex-backend

Clean, scalable folder structure implemented:

/app
  /main.py
  /routers
  /agents
  /models
  /utils


Virtual environment (venv) created and activated

Dependencies installed via requirements.txt

✅ Server & Configuration

.env file created with:

SUPABASE_URL

SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY (backend-only)

Secrets kept out of Git

Uvicorn server runs correctly with hot reload

✅ Core FastAPI App (main.py)

FastAPI app initialized successfully

CORS enabled for frontend:

http://localhost:3000

Health check endpoint implemented:

GET /health → { "status": "healthy" }


All routers registered cleanly

✅ Supabase Integration (Backend)

Supabase client initialized using service role key

Configuration isolated in models/database.py

Backend has full admin access (RLS bypass)

Verified Supabase connectivity via live queries

✅ API Endpoints Implemented & Verified
🔹 GET /subjects

Query parameters:

scheme_id

semester

branch

Fetches subjects directly from Supabase

Correct filtering and response structure

Tested successfully with real data

🔹 GET /videos

Query parameters:

topic_id

limit (default: 10)

Uses in-memory cache (7-day TTL)

Falls back to scout agent stub

Returns empty list (expected for Phase 1)

Endpoint wiring verified

✅ Caching Layer (utils/cache.py)

Simple in-memory dictionary cache

Structure:

cache[topic_id] = {
  videos: [...],
  expires_at: timestamp
}


Automatic invalidation after expiry

Ready for Redis replacement later

✅ Scout Agent Stub (agents/scout_agent.py)

Stub function implemented:

get_videos_for_topic(topic_id, limit)


Returns empty list for now

Clean interface for Phase 2 YouTube integration

🎯 Final Status

Person B responsibilities are COMPLETE.

Backend is:

Running

Tested

Supabase-connected

Frontend-ready

Designed for future scaling (agents, caching, auth)


🔜 Ready for Next Phase

Backend can now support:

Frontend dashboard queries

YouTube ingestion (Person D)

Auth integration (future)

Performance optimizations
