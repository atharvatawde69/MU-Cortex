prompt1: 
Create a Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS called 'mu-cortex-frontend'. File structure: /app /layout.tsx (root layout) /page.tsx (landing page with "Select Your Scheme" card) /(dashboard) /layout.tsx (authenticated layout) /page.tsx (subject dashboard) /[subject]/page.tsx (topic list for a subject) /[subject]/[topic]/page.tsx (video cards for a topic) /components /SchemeSelector.tsx (dropdown for 2019/2024 + branch + semester) /SubjectCard.tsx (displays subject with module count) /VideoCard.tsx (YouTube thumbnail + engagement score) /lib /supabase.ts (Supabase client initialization) /types.ts (TypeScript interfaces matching our DB schema) For the SchemeSelector component: - Use Shadcn UI dropdown components - On selection, store choice in localStorage AND send to Supabase users table - Lock the scheme - show a "locked" badge after selection - Include a small disclaimer: "Changing scheme later will reset your progress" For the landing page (app/page.tsx): - Center the SchemeSelector card - Add a tagline: "Your AI Study Partner for Mumbai University Exams" - Use a gradient background with MU's blue color (#003366) Install dependencies: @supabase/supabase-js, @shadcn/ui, lucide-reactGreat 

output1:
— the Next.js 14 app scaffold is now created successfully in C:\MU-Cortex\mu-cortex-frontend, and Supabase + lucide-react are installed. Next I’ll initialize shadcn/ui (non-interactive), add the dropdown/card/badge components we need, then create the exact /app, /components, and /lib files you listed and wire up the SchemeSelector + landing page UI.


prompt2:
Initialize shadcn/ui in this Next.js 14 app (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind).

Requirements:
1. Use default shadcn config (no custom theme).
2. Add only these shadcn components:
   - dropdown-menu
   - card
   - badge
   - button
3. Do NOT modify existing Tailwind config beyond what shadcn requires.

After setup, confirm shadcn is ready by showing:
- components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx
- components/ui/card.tsx
- components/ui/badge.tsx

output2:
✅ shadcn/ui initialized (default config) + required components added dropdown-menu.tsx, card.tsx, badge.tsx this is what cursor gave


prompt3:
Based on the existing Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui setup, complete the remaining requirements below.

CURRENT STATE (important context):
- shadcn/ui already initialized
- components/ui contains badge.tsx, button.tsx, card.tsx, dropdown-menu.tsx
- /app currently has layout.tsx, page.tsx, globals.css
- Supabase dependencies already installed

TASKS TO COMPLETE:

1. Create the missing folder & route structure:

/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx
/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx
/app/(dashboard)/[subject]/page.tsx
/app/(dashboard)/[subject]/[topic]/page.tsx

Each should export a valid React component with minimal placeholder UI.

---

2. Create missing components:

/components/SchemeSelector.tsx
/components/SubjectCard.tsx
/components/VideoCard.tsx

Details:
- SchemeSelector:
  - Use shadcn dropdown-menu + button + badge
  - Allow selecting:
    - scheme: 2019 | 2024
    - branch (string)
    - semester (number)
  - On first selection:
    - Store selection in localStorage under key "mu_cortex_scheme"
    - Lock the selector (disable further changes)
    - Show a shadcn <Badge> with text "Locked"
  - Show disclaimer text:
    "Changing scheme later will reset your progress"
  - For now, just console.log the selected values
  - DO NOT add Supabase write logic yet

- SubjectCard:
  - Use shadcn Card
  - Props: subjectName: string, moduleCount: number
  - Display subject name + module count

- VideoCard:
  - Use shadcn Card
  - Props: title, thumbnailUrl, engagementScore
  - Show thumbnail, title, engagement score

---

3. Update app/page.tsx (Landing Page):

- Center content vertically and horizontally
- Add heading text:
  "Your AI Study Partner for Mumbai University Exams"
- Place SchemeSelector inside a card
- Add a gradient background using MU blue (#003366 → darker shade)
- Ensure layout is responsive

---

4. Create Supabase client:

/lib/supabase.ts
- Initialize Supabase client using:
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Export the client

---

5. Create TypeScript types:

/lib/types.ts
- Define interfaces for:
  Subject
  Topic
  VideoResource
Based on the database schema (id, name, scheme_id, etc.)

---

RULES:
- Do NOT introduce authentication yet
- Do NOT use service role key
- Keep logic minimal and clean
- Ensure TypeScript passes with no errors

Return only confirmation of files created/updated.

🎉 SUCCESS. Person A — STEP 1B is COMPLETE.

Everything worked correctly and for the right reasons.

What you have officially achieved
✅ Frontend

Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui set up correctly

Landing page with SchemeSelector works

Lock / Reset logic works

localStorage persistence works

DevTools verified step by step

✅ Supabase (frontend integration)

Frontend writes to users table using anon key

Correct upsert with onConflict

RLS understood, debugged, and fixed properly

Insert + Update + Select policies aligned

Verified row insertion end-to-end

This is industry-grade debugging, not beginner stuff.

VERY IMPORTANT — What to remember (no action now)
Temporary RLS policies added (DEV ONLY)

You added 3 temporary policies:

anon INSERT

anon UPDATE

anon SELECT

⚠️ These are only for development/testing.

When auth is added later, these will be:

Tightened

Or removed

Or replaced with auth.uid()-based policies

👉 Do NOT remove them now.
👉 Just remember they exist.

You are done with this step ✔️
Person A — Step 1B: ✅ COMPLETE

You can confidently tell your team:

“Frontend skeleton + Supabase write path is working.”




What’s the next logical frontend step (preview only)

When you’re ready, the next step will be:

Build Subject Dashboard (/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx)

Read subjects from Supabase (SELECT, anon key)

Filter by:

scheme_id

semester

branch

Display via SubjectCard

But we do nothing until you ask.


✔️ Git hygiene correct

.env.local NOT committed

Only frontend-related files committed

Clear, meaningful commit message

Stable checkpoint created
