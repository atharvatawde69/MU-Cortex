✅ PERSON C — DATABASE / SUPABASE WORK (COMPLETE)

This summarizes everything you’ve successfully delivered as Person C.

✅ Database Design & Schema

PostgreSQL schema designed for Mumbai University exam prep

Tables created and verified:

users

subjects

topics

video_resources

predicted_questions

channel_whitelist

UUID primary keys with uuid_generate_v4()

created_at / updated_at handled via trigger

Referential integrity via foreign keys

Indexes added for performance

Constraints enforced (scheme, semester, module limits)

✅ Supabase Setup

Supabase project initialized

Schema executed successfully via SQL Editor

Tables visible and validated in Table Editor

RLS enabled on sensitive tables (users)

Environment variables prepared correctly:

.env.example

.env (local only, never committed)

Git hygiene enforced (.gitignore)

✅ Syllabus Data Collection & Seeding

Manual syllabus extraction completed:

AIML – Semester V & VI

2019 Scheme

Subjects seeded:

5 subjects total

Topics seeded:

30 topics total

Mapped correctly to subjects

module_number constraints respected

Verified:

Subject count

Topic count

Subject ↔ topic relationships

✅ Supabase Verification

SQL-based validation completed:

Subject counts

Topic counts

Foreign-key integrity

Table Editor validation completed:

Data visible

Correct filtering by scheme_id = 2019

Database is confirmed as source of truth

✅ Git & Project Hygiene

Git repository initialized locally

Safe files committed:

schema.sql

syllabus_seed_data.csv

DATABASE_SETUP.md

Docs

Secrets never committed

GitHub push optional (not required yet)

✅ Team Handoff Documentation

DATABASE_SETUP.md created and structured

Clearly documented:

Tables

Current data status

Frontend usage (anon key)

Backend usage (service role)

Next steps per role

Keys explicitly redacted

Safe for Git

✅ Frontend Integration Support (as Database Owner)

Guided anon-key usage correctly

Designed correct RLS strategy

Added temporary DEV RLS policies:

anon INSERT

anon UPDATE

anon SELECT

Debugged and fixed:

RLS violations

Upsert conflict handling

PostgREST behavior

Verified frontend → Supabase write end-to-end

⚠️ Known TEMPORARY DEV CONFIG (Important)

These are intentional and temporary:

anon can INSERT / UPDATE / SELECT users

Placeholder email used:

temp_user@mu-cortex.local


👉 To be replaced when auth is implemented.

🎯 Final Status

Person C responsibilities are COMPLETE.

Database is live

Data is correct

Schema is stable

Frontend + backend are unblocked

Project can move forward safely
