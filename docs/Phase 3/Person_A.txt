Perfect — here is the clean, authoritative PERSON A status update, written in the same tone, rigor, and structure as PERSON C, with no fluff and no scope creep. This is Phase-3-final–ready.

✅ PERSON A — CURRENT STATUS (FINAL, PHASE 3)

This status reflects the final executed frontend scope for Phase 3, after backend intelligence stabilized and PYQ architecture was corrected.

🔹 TASK A1: Community Notes Integration

Status: ✅ COMPLETED & STABLE

What was built

Frontend integration with community_resources (Supabase)

Notes displayed per subject

Telegram-first model (no file hosting in app)

Features

File metadata shown:

Filename

File size (KB / MB)

Relative upload time

Tags rendered safely (array / JSON / CSV tolerant)

“Open in Telegram” deep link

Responsive card-based layout

Moderation-aware behavior (important)

❌ Unmoderated notes hidden from students

🟡 Pending moderation visible only internally (testing/admin)

✅ Approved notes shown first

UX states handled

Loading (skeletons)

Empty state

Error fallback

✔️ Notes pipeline complete and aligned with moderation discipline
✔️ No backend changes required

🔹 TASK A2: Questions UI (PYQs) — Architectural Correction

Status: ✅ COMPLETED (WITH DESIGN FIX)

Initial assumption (discarded)

Questions shown at topic/module level

Expected fine-grained subtopics

Problem

MU PYQs span multiple subtopics

Topics table is module-only

Led to empty states and duplication

Final decision (LOCKED)

Questions moved to SUBJECT level

One “Questions” tab per subject

Topic pages now show:

Videos

Notes only

Why this is correct

Matches MU exam reality

Frequency logic is subject-wide

Cleaner student mental model

Avoids fake granularity

✔️ Architecture corrected before prediction layer
✔️ No data rework needed later

🔹 TASK A3: Questions Display + Filtering

Status: ✅ COMPLETED

UI features

Question cards with:

Question text

Marks badge (2M / 5M / 10M)

Frequency placeholder badge

Filters:

Marks filter

High-frequency toggle (mocked)

Sorting:

Frequency (default)

Marks

Result count badge

Clean empty & loading states

Technical correctness

React hook order fixed

useMemo used correctly

No console warnings

Frequency logic clearly marked temporary

✔️ UI-first implementation ready for Phase 4 data
✔️ No rework expected

🔹 TASK A4: Answer Generation UI (End-to-End)

Status: ✅ COMPLETED & VERIFIED

What works

“Generate Answer” per question

Calls /answers/generate API

Loading, error, and retry handling

One expanded answer at a time

Regeneration supported

Answer rendering

Bold keyword highlighting

[DIAGRAM: ...] rendered as visual blocks

Line breaks preserved

Copy-to-clipboard

Generation timestamp

PDF export stubbed (future)

Safety

HTML sanitized

No XSS risk

✔️ Full Question → Answer → Display flow tested
✔️ Student-ready output

🔹 TASK A5: Prompt-Driven UX Support

Status: ✅ COMPLETED (FRONTEND-READY)

Although prompts live in backend, frontend fully supports:

Longer structured answers

Bullet-heavy format (Bharat-style learning)

Real-world examples shown separately

Comparison questions rendered cleanly (tables supported)

Large answers handled without layout issues

✔️ Frontend does not constrain answer quality
✔️ Prompt evolution will not require UI changes
