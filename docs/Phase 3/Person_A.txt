🟡 PERSON A — FRONTEND (PHASE 3)

Status: ✅ COMPLETED & STABLE

🎯 ORIGINAL INTENT (PHASE 3)

Provide a frontend layer that:

Surfaces PYQs, answers, and community notes

Integrates smoothly with backend intelligence

Keeps UI exam-focused, minimal, and scalable

✅ WHAT WE ACHIEVED (FINAL STATE)
1️⃣ Community Notes Integration (Telegram → Supabase → UI)

Status: ✅ Complete

What works now:

Notes fetched from community_resources table

Scoped by subject

No file storage — metadata only (Telegram-first flow)

“Open in Telegram” deep link for access

Tags rendered cleanly (multi-format safe)

File size + relative time displayed

Mobile-friendly cards

Moderation-aware UI:

❌ Unmoderated notes hidden from students

🟡 Pending moderation shown lower (internal/testing)

✅ Moderated notes shown first

UX states handled:

Loading

Empty (no notes yet)

Error (safe fallback)

2️⃣ Questions UI (PYQs) — Re-Architected

Status: ✅ Complete (with improved scope)

🔁 Original approach (discarded):

Questions shown at topic/module level

Assumed fine-grained subtopics existed

Caused duplication and empty states

✅ Final approach (adopted):

Questions moved to SUBJECT level

Single “Questions” tab per subject

Topic pages now focus on Videos + Notes only

Why this is correct:

MU PYQs are not module-pure

Questions span multiple subtopics

Frequency-based ranking belongs at subject scope

Cleaner mental model for students

3️⃣ Questions Display + Filtering

Status: ✅ Complete

UI Features:

Question cards with:

Question text

Marks badge (2M / 5M / 10M)

Frequency placeholder badge

Filters:

Marks filter (All / 2 / 5 / 10)

High-frequency toggle (mocked)

Sorting:

By frequency (default)

By marks

Result count badge

Empty & loading states

Technical highlights:

Hooks order fixed (no React warnings)

useMemo used correctly

Frequency logic clearly marked as temporary

4️⃣ Answer Generation UI (End-to-End)

Status: ✅ Fully integrated & tested

What works:

“Generate Answer” button per question

Calls /answers/generate backend API

MU-style formatted output

One answer expanded at a time

Regenerate support

Loading + error handling

Answer Rendering:

Bold keywords

[DIAGRAM: …] rendered as visual blocks

Line breaks preserved

Copy-to-clipboard

Timestamp shown

PDF button stubbed (future)

5️⃣ Prompt-Driven UX Improvements (Frontend-visible)

Status: ✅ Applied

Even though prompt logic is backend:

Frontend now supports:

Longer structured answers

Bullet-heavy format (Bharat-style learning)

Real-world examples clearly separated

Comparison questions ready for tables

UI handles larger, richer answers gracefully

🔁 WHAT CHANGED FROM INITIAL PHASE 3 PLAN
Area	Initial Plan	Final Implementation
Questions scope	Topic-level	Subject-level (corrected)
Notes visibility	Immediate	Moderation-aware
Answer UI	Basic text	Structured, formatted, exam-ready
Frequency	Backend-driven	UI-first placeholder

🧠 CURRENT FRONTEND STATE (SUMMARY)

Subjects → Topics (Videos / Notes)

Subjects → Questions (PYQs + Answers)

Zero broken routes

No console errors

Mobile responsive

Student-first UX
