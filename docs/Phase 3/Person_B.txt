✅ PHASE 3 — PERSON B: ANSWER ENGINE

Status: Completed & Stable (with planned extensions)

🔹 What Person B Has Achieved (Delivered)
🧠 Core Answer Engine

 Backend LLM client integrated (Gemini 2.5 Flash)

 Async-safe, venv-stable runtime

 Clean environment separation (no key leakage)

 Single reusable text-generation interface

📚 Question Access & Control

 Canonical question fetch via question_id

 Uses normalized questions table

 Clean failure handling (404 / 400)

 Decoupled from ingestion logic (Person C)

✍️ MU-Style Prompt System

 Dedicated prompt module (answer_generator.py)

 Strict 10-mark MU template:

Introduction

10–15 bullet points

Mandatory diagram

Mandatory worked example

Conclusion

 Strict 5-mark MU template:

Definition

5–7 key points

Example or diagram

 Word-count discipline

 Examiner-aligned tone (clear, student-level)

🌐 Answer Generation API

 POST /answers/generate

 Marks-aware routing (5 vs 10)

 Stable request/response contract

 Safe error handling (never crashes)

🎥 Context Grounding (Optional, Non-Blocking)

 YouTube transcript integration

 Uses ranked videos (Auto-Scout output)

 Keyword-based transcript filtering

 Context injected without breaking MU structure

 Graceful fallback if transcript unavailable

🧪 Quality & Validation

 Manual testing with real MU PYQs

 10-mark answers verified (full-mark quality)

 5-mark answers verified

 Transcript-positive case verified

 Transcript-fallback behavior verified

 End-to-end stability confirmed

🟡 Future Acknowledged Add-ons (NOT part of Phase 3)

These are intentionally deferred but fully compatible with the current design.

📖 Reference Book Integration (High Priority – Future)

 Ingest MU-recommended reference books (from syllabus PDFs)

 Chapter-wise / topic-wise text chunking

 Use book text as primary context

 Treat YouTube transcripts as secondary enrichment

 Reuse existing context slot in prompt system

 No API redesign required

Planned context hierarchy:

Reference Book Text (Primary)
      ↓
PYQ Frequency / Marks Pattern
      ↓
YouTube Transcript (Optional)

📊 Intelligence Enhancements

 PYQ frequency-based emphasis in answers

 Topic importance weighting

 Difficulty-level tagging (easy / medium / hard)

 Exam trend awareness (repeated questions)

🧩 Answer Quality Improvements

 Diagram auto-generation (ASCII / SVG hints)

 Formula emphasis tuning

 Answer length fine-tuning per examiner style

 Multi-language (English + Hinglish explanations)

⚙️ System & Scale

 Cache generated answers (idempotent reuse)

 Rate limiting & abuse protection

 LLM provider abstraction (Gemini ↔ others)

 Python upgrade (3.11+) & SDK migration (google.genai)

🟢 Final Assessment

Person B has successfully delivered a complete, exam-aligned Answer Engine.
The system is:

Stable

Extensible

Exam-accurate

Architecturally future-proof

All future enhancements can be added without breaking Phase 3 work.
