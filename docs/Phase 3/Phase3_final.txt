✅ REVISED PHASE 3 — VERIFIED & FINAL STATUS

(Post-fixes, Post-review app, Architecturally consistent, SCALED)

This document reflects the true current state of Phase 3 after all fixes, pivots, UX improvements, and scaled data ingestion.

✅ PERSON D — Telegram Ingestion

Status: ✅ DONE (Demo-ready, Locked)

What is complete

✅ Telegram bot listens to configured channel

✅ PDF/image uploads ingested into community_resources

✅ Tags, metadata, file size captured

✅ Bot runs locally for demos

✅ Deep-linking to Telegram preserved (no file duplication)

Intentional design choices

⚠️ Manual moderation required (no auto-approval)

⚠️ No frontend write access from bot (safety)

Verdict

✔️ Meets Phase 3 requirements

✔️ Correct moderation-first design

🔒 No further changes needed in Phase 3

✅ PERSON C — PYQ Extraction, Ingestion & Review

Status: ✅ COMPLETE, SCALED, OPERATIONAL

🔹 Extraction & Parsing

✅ Gemini Vision–based PDF parsing adopted

✅ OCR pipeline abandoned (retained as fallback)

✅ Handles:

OR blocks

Sub-questions

Marks

Layout

✅ Accuracy: ~85–95% (validated on real MU PDFs)

🔹 Ingestion (UPDATED)

✅ Canonical questions stored in questions

✅ Exam history stored in question_appearances

✅ SHA-based deduplication

✅ Idempotent ingestion

✅ <10 min per paper end-to-end

🔹 Review & Approval (FINAL STATE)

✅ Streamlit review app BUILT & USED

✅ Shows:

All questions by default

Subject-filtered questions

Approved vs unapproved counts

✅ Actions:

Approve single

Reject & delete

Approve all visible

✅ Optimized UX:

Session-state caching

No refetch per action

Instant counter updates

🔹 Current Scale (IMPORTANT UPDATE)

✅ Total papers ingested: 12

AI: 6

CN: 6

✅ Canonical questions: 168

✅ Question appearances: 191

✅ Approval status: Reviewed & approved

➡️ Frequency and prediction are now statistically meaningful.

🔹 What is NOT done (intentional)

❌ Fully automated batch runner (process_all.py)

❌ Automatic semantic merging of near-duplicate questions

Deferred cleanly to Phase 4

Verdict

✔️ Core Person C deliverables are fully met

✔️ Data volume requirement satisfied

🟢 Ready for Phase 4 analytics

✅ PERSON B — Answer Engine

Status: ✅ DONE + ENHANCED (Exceeds Scope)

What works

✅ Answer generation using real PYQs

✅ MU-style enforcement:

5M / 10M formats

Bullet-first structure

Mandatory examples

Diagram placeholders

✅ Expanded keyword coverage

✅ Real-world examples added outside word count

✅ Plain-English logic (symbols removed)

✅ Comparison questions rendered as tables

✅ YouTube transcript grounding (optional, safe fallback)

Quality verification

✅ Tested on multiple real PYQs

✅ Exam-ready answers

✅ No frontend constraints on answer length

What is NOT done (intentional)

❌ Answer caching (Phase 4 optimization)

❌ Student rating loop (future)

Verdict

✔️ Fully complete

✔️ Prompt quality is Phase-4 ready

✅ PERSON A — Frontend Integration

Status: ✅ DONE & ARCHITECTURALLY CORRECT

🔹 Community Notes

✅ Subject-scoped notes
